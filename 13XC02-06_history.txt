-----[ Revision 1.5 ]-----
[ 2009-02-26 17:15:07 by ts ]
 
xc02_drv.c
- supports XC02 Rev 1 with 2nd display (independent switching and brightness)
xc02_ctrl.c
- added options -o to select 1st or 2nd display and -m for minicard power,
  updated usage text

xc02_ctrl.c
- non ASCII chars in -i info dump caused Windows to display wrong characters,
  replaced dump line to "degree Celsius"
13xc0206.xml
- Key <value> was missing for SMB_DEVADDR, so this registry key wasnt set.
- added value as 0x12 so default works under Win (Linux uses system.dsc files)

- added DGBWRT macros in each Get/SetStat for thorough debugging
xc02_ctrl.c:
- displays more internal info
- specifier _MAPILIB added in SigHandler() routine
- changed option s to accept a value (magic 0xa8 is expected for
